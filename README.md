# Autumn Reddit

## ABOUT

-   a Reddit API project for portfolio
-   scroll through reddit with a new look

-   ### Drawbacks

    -   If you look close enough you will see that the background image is not seamless
    -   You can't upvote
    -   You can't comment
    -   You can only search for subreddits in the search bar
    -   Reddit Video previews don't have any audio unless you go to the post (The post is always linked, just click the title of the post)

        Why does it have these drawbacks? Well, it's mostly because I couldn't get around actually updating without using Reddit's API, which needs a fee now, and implementing those functions seems hard without Reddit API. For the other features, I couldn't figure out how to implement.

## TO-DO list

Stuff I need to develop or fix :P

-   remember to link repository in Notes.js
-   make viewable comment section of a post and make it appear when user clicks comments button
-   after search the page must go to the top of the page


-   fix replies in Comment.js

-   some scrollbars have a white block at the bottom (specifically in comments)

-   ### Renders in Article.js

    -   test video render in Article.js (optional)
    -   test gallery render in Article.js (optional)
    -   fix comment render in Article.js (I don't know how yet)
    -   try again to make outside website preview render in Article.js (optional)

-   check for more bugs and run more tests
